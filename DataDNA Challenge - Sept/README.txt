# Loan Data Analysis â€“ Onyx September DataDNA Challenge
The original dataset used in this project comes from the Onyx DataDNA Challenge.
Due to not knowing whether this dataset is open for public, this repository will not include the dataset.
However, it is publicly accessible and can be downloaded from the official source: https://datadna.onyxdata.co.uk/challenges/

A project to analyze loan risk and customer behavior machine learning on the Onyx DataDNA dataset. The insight then can be used to build a Power BI dashboard

## Overview
This project demonstrates a data-driven approach to segment customers based on loan risk and identify potential default patterns. Machine learning models were used to estimate default probabilities and get Feature Importance / SHAP Values, and as an added bonus: Thompson Sampling demo was applied to optimize risk mitigation strategies per segment.

## Dataset
- Source: Onyx DataDNA Challenge  
- Data includes 30,000+ customers with features such as demographics, account information, and financial metrics.  
- Each customer is labeled with loan outcomes (default / non-default).

## Notebook
- datadna.ipynb: contains the analysis and ML
- thompson_sampling.ipynb: contains the code for prescriptive thompson sampling. This part isn't needed for DataDNA, just for self exploration and learning.

## Results
- Segmented customers into meaningful clusters based on risk and behavior.  
- Estimated default probabilities per customer to inform risk strategies.  
- Applied Thompson Sampling to prioritize interventions, improving decision-making efficiency.
